# My logistics Application

A new Flutter logistics project.

I built this application from scratch and on flutter framework so i can learn more about dart, it's instances, and the logic side of it too. Also during my journey, i learnt how to use the google map and also how to refactor my code and reuseability of code. It was a fun, and exciting experience too. Let me know what you think about my application. See screenshots below.
